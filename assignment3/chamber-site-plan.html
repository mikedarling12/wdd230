        <h1>Color Schema</h1>
        <h3>Main Color: FB8500</h3>
        <p>I will be using this color because of orange's association with warmth and excitement, leading locals to get excited
            about local businesses. This will be used in headings primarily.
        </p>
        <h3>Accent: 8ECAE6</h3>
        <p>I will be using this color because of blue's association with dependability and wisdom. We want the locals to trust us
            as we serve them and their community. This will be used in supporting sections and as a selection color in menus.
