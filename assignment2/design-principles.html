            <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
            <p>Yugioh TCG Website</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/">https://www.yugioh-card.com/</a></p>

            <p>Yugioh's main website demonstrates the rule of thirds well. 
                By viewing the website in the perspective of thirds, you can see how each part of the website is divided this way. 
                You have a main attraction in the middle of the screen, and supporting content around the outside.</p>

            <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>
            <p>Flesh and Blood TCG Website</p>
            <p><a href="https://fabtcg.com/">https://fabtcg.com/</a></p>
            <img src="images/fab-website.png" alt="image of the Flesh-and-Blood website at mobile size">
            <p>FAB's website makes excellent use of simple design. In this screenshot, you have very little information that you need
                to proccess in order to go where you want to. You have a content card with an article link, and ways to pan through the 
                other recent articles.

            <h2>Fitt's Law</h2>
            <p>Nintendo's Main Website</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/">https://www.nintendo.com/</a></p>
            <img src="images/nintendo-website.png" alt="image of the Nintendo website at mobile size">
            <p>The Nintendo website, much like a toy store, has a lot of things to touch. Just in this one screenshot, you can see how
                many buttons are available to click on and learn more about. And it is all close together, making the clicking even
                easier. Additionally, while it is not immediately noticable from the screenshot, these content cards are the entire 
                button themselves, allowing for additional convinence.
